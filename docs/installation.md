## Versioning Schema

The versioning schema is `{major}.{minor}.{patch}[{release}{build}]` where the
latter part (release and build) is optional.

It is recommended to do `--dry-run` prior to your actual run.

```bash
# increase version identifier
bumpversion [major/minor/patch/release/build]  # --verbose --dry-run

# e.g.
bumpversion minor  # e.g. 0.5.1 --> 0.6.0
bumpversion minor --new-version 0.7.0  # e.g. 0.5.1 --> 0.7.0
```
